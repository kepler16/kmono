# ðŸ‘˜ kmono - monorepo build/release tool

## Overview

kmono is a build tool designed specifically for managing Clojure monorepos. With features like automatic change detection via git, semantic versioning through commit prefixes, and parallel build processing, kmono aims to simplify and automate your monorepo experience.

## Quick Start

**Directory Structure**

Ensure your monorepo has the following directory structure:

```
repo-root
  â”œâ”€â”€ packages
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ package1
  â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ deps.edn
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ package2
  â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ deps.edn
  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ package3
  â”‚       â””â”€â”€ deps.edn
  â””â”€â”€ deps.edn (for starting monorepo repl and kmono alias)
```

**Basic Usage**

Root `deps.edn`:
```clojure
{:deps {;; add local/root deps for all packages to start repo level REPL (optional)
        {kepler16/package1 {:local/root "packages/package1"}}}
 :aliases {:kmono {:deps {kepler16/kmono {:mvn/version "1.0.0.0"}}
                   :ns-default k16.kmono.api}}}
```

All commands below runs against all changed packages.

Build a package:

```sh
clojure -T:kmono run :exec :build
```

Deploy a package:

```sh
clojure -T:kmono run :exec :release
```

Run a custom command:

```sh
clojure -T:kmono run :exec \"just test\"
```

During each command following environment variables are passed:
- `KMONO_PKG_VERSION` - version of a package
- `KMONO_PKG_DEPS` - dependency overrides for a package
- `KMONO_PKG_NAME` - full name of a package artifact, e.g. `com.example/my-lib`

## Additional CLI arguments

One can pass this CLI args to `-T:kmono` command
- `:include-unchanged?` - `boolean`, should kmono include unchanged packages into build process (default `false`)
- `:snapshot?` - `boolean`, whether release is a snapshot, useful when releasing from PR branch (default `true`)
- `:create-tags?` - `boolean`, should kmono create new baseline tags after release. Usually baseline tags are created on master releases, not snapshots (default `false`)
- `:glob` - `string`, where to search for packages, defaults to `"packages/*"`
- `:build-cmd` - `string`, overrides `build-cmd` option from package kmono config
- `:release-cmd` - `string`, overrides `release-cmd` option from package kmono config
- `:repo-root` - `string`, root of the monorepo, defaults to `"."`
- `:dry-run?` - `boolean`, dry run to check command output (default `false`)

## Configuration

Package-specific configurations are done within each `deps.edn` file under the `:kmono/config` key:

```clj
:kmono/config {;; maven artifact's group
               :group com.example
               ;; maven's artifactId
               ;; this is optional and inferred from a package's dir name
               :artifact my-lib
               ;; below are two builtin commands
               ;; run :exec :build
               :build-cmd "just build"
               ;; run  :exec :release
               :release-cmd "just release"}
```

## Features

- **Change Detection**: Calculates changes per package by parsing git history for each package directory.
- **Semantic Versioning**: Uses Angular-style commit prefixes to determine the type of version bump.
- **Dependency Graph**: Creates a graph of interdependent packages and builds them in parallel groups.
- **Local Dependency Management**: Replaces `local/root` dependencies with real version numbers during the build.

## Limitations

- Relies on git tags for versioning.
- Requires a baseline tag; otherwise, the version defaults to `0.0.0.0`.
- Currently only Clojure deps.edn specific.

## What kmono is not

- Not a build tool - it doesn't build, only runs commands
- Not a release tool - see above

## Future Plans

- Support for `kmono.edn` as an alternative config file.
- Extend support to other programming languages by handling local dependencies more generically.
